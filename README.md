Project 1: Storing found keywords in a linked list, and printing out the linked list elements.
Project 2: Given a context-free grammar G as input, calculate FIRST and FOLLOW sets for all non-terminals of the grammar and determine if each of the
non-terminals in G generate a string of length 1.
Project 3: A parser and syntax checker for a simple language.  Builds an abstract syntax tree.
Project 4: An interpreter that creates a syntax graph for a given language, and a compiler to execute the resulting syntax graph.
